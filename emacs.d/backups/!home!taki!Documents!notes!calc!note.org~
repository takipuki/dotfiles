* Functions
A function is a relation between a dependent and an independent
variable. For example,
$$ y = 3x + 1 $$
is a function because it's a relation between $x$ (independent) and
$y$ (dependent).

A function (e.g. $f(x)$) is defined if and only if for every possible
value of $x$ there is a single corresponding value of $f(x)$. For example,
$$ f(x) = \sqrt{x} $$
is not a valid function definition because it's not defined for any
negative value of $x$.

** Domain
The domain of a function ($f(x)$) is the set of all possible values of
the independent variable ($x$). For example, the function
$$ f(x) = 3x + 1 $$
has the domain $(-\infty, \infty)$.

Domains can be natural or restricted. The function
$$ f(x) = \sqrt{x} $$
is not valid for natural domains; so its domain must be restricted to make the definition valid.
So by removing all negative values of $x$, the domain becomes $[0, \infty)$.

** Range
The range of a function ($f(x)$) is the set of all values of the
dependent variable ($f(x)$) corresponding to some value of the independent
variable ($x$). The function
$$ f(x) = x^2 $$
has the range $[0, \infty)$ because the square of any real number is positive.
